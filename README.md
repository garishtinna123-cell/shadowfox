# 🐍 Python Internship – Task One (Beginner Level)

This repository contains the *beginner-level Python tasks* completed as part of a one-month Python internship.  
The tasks focus on fundamental Python programming concepts such as *variables, numbers, lists, conditionals, loops, dictionaries, file handling, classes, and inheritance*.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To strengthen understanding of *core Python concepts* and gain hands-on experience with writing functional Python programs.  
Interns are required to complete *five out of nine subheadings*, implementing all the programs listed under the chosen headings.

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- *Variables and Data Types* – Working with integers, floats, strings, and booleans.  
- *Numbers & Mathematical Operations* – Arithmetic operations, built-in functions, and numeric manipulations.  
- *Lists* – Creating, indexing, slicing, modifying, and looping through lists.  
- *If Conditions* – Decision-making using if, elif, and else statements.  
- *For Loops* – Iterating over sequences, using range(), and nested loops.  
- *Dictionaries* – Key-value pair storage, updating, accessing, and iterating over dictionaries.  
- *File Handling* – Reading from and writing to files using open(), read(), write(), and context managers.  
- *Classes & Objects* – Creating classes, initializing objects, using instance and class variables.  
- *Inheritance* – Demonstrating single and multiple inheritance, method overriding, and super() usage.
